# JavaNeuralNet
Neural Network written in Java (WIP)

After learning how neural networks work, this is my self-imagined and self-written program for a neural network written in Java using Eclipse IDE. Code is for reference only.

To-Do: 
1. Abstract Code to utilize different activation functions (currently using sigmoid).
2. Abstract code to receive data input and expected output in the form of text files/spreadsheets, and outputting results in similar fashion.
3. Build an executable for the program.
